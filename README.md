# Food Delivery Platform

A production-grade microservices-based food delivery platform built using Java and Spring Boot, focusing on scalability, asynchronous communication, and real-world backend design patterns.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Eureka Service Registry
- JWT Authentication
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Kafka 
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Services
- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- API Gateway
- User Service
- Restaurant Service
- Order Service 
- Payment Service
- Delivery Service

## How to Run
1. Start Eureka Server
2. Start API Gateway
3. Start individual services

## end to end flow
Client
  ↓
API Gateway
  ↓
User Service
  ↓
JWT issued (userId, role)

- JWT is generated by User Service
- Client stores token
- Token is sent with every request


## order creation event
Client (JWT)
  ↓
API Gateway
  ├─ validates JWT
  ├─ checks role & path permissions
  ↓
Order Service
  ├─ creates order
  ├─ persists order
  └─ publishes ORDER_CREATED event
 
 ## Payment (ASYNC, Kafka)

Order Service
  ↓
Kafka: order-events (ORDER_CREATED)
  ↓
Payment Service
  ├─ processes payment
  └─ publishes PAYMENT_SUCCESS / PAYMENT_FAILED

## Delivery (ASYNC, Kafka)
Kafka: payment-events
  ↓
Order Service (status = PAID)
  ↓
Kafka: order-confirmed-events
  ↓
Delivery Service
  ├─ assigns delivery
  └─ publishes OUT_FOR_DELIVERY / DELIVERED

## Final State
Kafka: delivery-events
  ↓
Order Service
  └─ status = DELIVERED


## Observability and Monitoring

- doker-compose up -d
- docker ps
- docker exec -it mysql mysql -uroot -proot
- create database userdb;
- create database orderdb;
- show databases;
- docker exec -it mongodb mongosh
- docker compose down
